### App Description
This app is a basic demonstration of numerous key features most apps utilize such as user interactions with buttons, the view, as well as the keyboard. The application not only portrays these features intuitively, but it is also very lively by its ability to augment the colors of the view and the text color. 

### App Walk-though
